//   The simplest use of fetch takes a single argument - the url to the resource you want to fetch - and returns what is known as a Promise.

//   The first .then() block converts the raw response into JSON (since thatâ€™s what we are expecting from What Does Trump Thinks). To use the actual data, we need to chain another .then() method and then access the data from there.
  
//   The catch block executes only if the fetch request or any of the then blocks above it throw an error. In a real-world application, you will need to handle errors properly, perhaps by showing a notification to the user, but logging text to the console would suffice for our purposes here.
